# Shared Count (frontend)

This is a React Native app used to connect people in rooms to count simultaneously from many devices. A good use example is when counting pumps from an equip in an sports event.
The backend is written in Python Django and the connection is made with WebSockets. The backend is in another repository in GitLab.
